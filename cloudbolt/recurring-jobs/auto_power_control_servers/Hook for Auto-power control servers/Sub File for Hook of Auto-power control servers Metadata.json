    "description": "This plug-in enables auto-powering off of servers for periods of the day. This can be useful for servers that do not need to run at night, to save on public cloud costs/resource consumption at those times of the day.\n\nTo use this feature, go to a server's details page and configure a power schedule on the tab or use the Power Schedule parameter at order time. When this action runs it will look for the ScheduledTime models created by you setting the power schedule, and use them to determine which servers should be powered on or off at the current time. \n\nCloudBolt will use its own server time to judge whether it is the right time to power on and off VMs, so make sure you know what time it is on the CB server and that the timezone is right. \n\nAlso note that the recurring job that runs this action is expected to be run every hour on the hour. If it is run on a different schedule, that will impact when servers are powered on or off. The power change will only happen if the job runs during the hour on the day when a power change is scheduled.",
